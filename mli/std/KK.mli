  [— Axioms 1-3 of Mendelson, p.57, are here included from theory L
     where they are named A1, A2, A3. Modus ponens (MP) is likewise
     included from theory L. Mendelson axioms 4 (resp. 5)
     are here called K1 (resp. K2). —]


  — Treated as axioms in Mendelson:

  rule A12. 𝒙 not free in 𝑩, 𝑨 ⇒ 𝑩 ⊢ ∃𝒙 𝑨 ⇒ 𝑩. — Existence.
