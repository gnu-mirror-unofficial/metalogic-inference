rule T1C. object 𝒙₁₀, 𝒚₁₀, 𝒛₁₀.
  𝒙₁₀ = 𝒚₁₀, 𝒚₁₀ = 𝒛₁₀ ⊢ 𝒙₁₀ = 𝒛₁₀.
[𝒙₁₀ ↦ '𝒕 ⋅ 1][𝒛₁₀ ↦ '𝒕]
∴ '𝒕 ⋅ 1 = 𝒚₁₀, 𝒚₁₀ = '𝒕
rule T1C. object 𝒙₂₀, 𝒚₂₀, 𝒛₂₀.
  𝒙₂₀ = 𝒚₂₀, 𝒚₂₀ = 𝒛₂₀ ⊢ 𝒙₂₀ = 𝒛₂₀.
rule T1B. object 𝒙₂₁, 𝒚₂₁.
  𝒙₂₁ = 𝒚₂₁ ⊢ 𝒚₂₁ = 𝒙₂₁.
[𝒙₂₀ ↦ '𝒕 ⋅ 1][𝒛₂₀ ↦ 𝒚₁₀][𝒚₂₁ ↦ 𝒚₁₀][𝒙₂₁ ↦ '𝒕]
∴ '𝒕 ⋅ 1 = 𝒚₂₀, 𝒚₂₀ = 𝒚₁₀, '𝒕 = 𝒚₁₀
axiom S8. object 𝑥₃₀, 𝑦₃₀.
  𝑥₃₀ ⋅ s(𝑦₃₀) = 𝑥₃₀ ⋅ 𝑦₃₀ + 𝑥₃₀.

rule T1E. object 𝒓₃₁, 𝒔₃₁, 𝒕₃₁.
  𝒕₃₁ = 𝒓₃₁ ⊢ 𝒕₃₁ + 𝒔₃₁ = 𝒓₃₁ + 𝒔₃₁.
axiom T1f. object 𝒕₃₂.
  𝒕₃₂ = 0 + 𝒕₃₂.
