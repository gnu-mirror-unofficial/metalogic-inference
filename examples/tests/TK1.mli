  — Example of variable dependencies, Mendelson, p. 60: Let 𝑩₁, 𝑩₂, 𝑩₃, 𝑩₄, 𝑩₅
  — respectively be the statement formulas of the correspondingly numbered prooflines.
  — Then in the given proof:
  — 𝑩₁ and 𝑩₂ depend on premise 𝑨.
  — 𝑩₃ depends on premise ∀𝑥 𝑨 ⇒ 𝑪.
  — 𝑩₄ and 𝑩₅ depend on premises 𝑨 and ∀𝑥 𝑨 ⇒ 𝑪.
  lemma X4. formula 𝑨, 𝑪.
    𝑨, ∀𝑥 𝑨 ⇒ 𝑪 ⊢ ∀𝑥 𝑪
  proof                  — Depends on premise(s):
    1. 𝑨 by premise.          — 𝑨
    2. ∀𝑥 𝑨 by 1, Gen.        — 𝑨
    3. ∀𝑥 𝑨 ⇒ 𝑪 by premise.  — ∀𝑥 𝑨 ⇒ 𝑪
