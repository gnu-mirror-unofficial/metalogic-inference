{— trace result —}

  — Fails, as not true for every choice of t, i.e., the interpretation
  — is that 0 + 0 = 0 follows from all versions of the premise t + 0 = t,
  — which is not true if t is not equal to 0, corresponding to the
  — closed formula ∀x: (x + 0 = x ⇒ 0 + 0 = 0), which is not true.
  — True is however (∀x: (x + 0 = x) ⇒ 0 + 0 = 0, see the next lemma.
  lemma Xs. object t.
    t + 0 = t ⊢ 0 + 0 = 0
  by premise.


  — This version succeeds, as ∀x: x + 0 = x is applicable to
  — all substitutions of x.
  lemma Xt.
    ∀x: x + 0 = x ⊢ 0 + 0 = 0
   conclusion by premise, K1.
