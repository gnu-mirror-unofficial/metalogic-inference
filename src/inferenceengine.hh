  /* Calculation of proofs:

  The inference-engine maintains an inference-tree with edges an alternative,
  a pair (s, g) where s is a substitution, and g is a goal (formula) that
  must be proved for the completetion of the proof. Each path from the root
  in the inference-tree corresponds to a proof-line. The proof-line is 
  successful if the last edge has an empty (trivially true) goal. The proof
  line is a failure if an end-goal cannot be extended with a new edge. The
  inference-tree can be extended by choosing an arbitrary end-edge, and see
  if the end-goal can, via unification, produce a list of new alternatives,
  which then can be inserted as edges into the inference-tree. Currently,
  a breadth-frist search is used; one point is that if there is a finite proof,
  it will always be found.
